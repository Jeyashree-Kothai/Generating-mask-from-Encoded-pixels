# Generating-mask-from-Encoded-pixels

Working with images are always interesting especially when dpecific locations of the images are encoded and given in the form of pixel values in a CSV File . 

In such a situation , we need to generate masks from Encoded pixels using numpy's np.zero method. this is one of the data preprocessing step that we do before training our model further. 

Here's one such Kaggle challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/severstal-steel-defect-detection/code

In this severstal steel defect detection csv file is given and we need to generate mask image for the encoded pixel. the detailed step by step procudure is explained along with code in the ipynb file
